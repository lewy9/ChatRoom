* To create a private room, you need to type the password.
* To create a public room, just ignore the password input box. 
* Avoid refreshing the page, this will mess up the UI.
* The user needs to click "logout" button to actually log out. And the number of connected users can display correctly.
* After joining the room, click other people's name to perform private message sending, ban or kick...

### Creative Portion
* The creator of the room can add a password for a public room, or change the password for a private room. (The current users in that room won't be automatically kicked. But the next time, they will be asked for a password to enter the room)
* The creator of the room can grant admin for another user.(The admin position will be swapped.)
* All the created rooms are displayed in the page, and you can click one of them to join.
* It will display the current number of connected users.
